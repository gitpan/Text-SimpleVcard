DESCRIPTION

simplevCard - This package provides an API to reading a single vCard. A vCard
is an electronic business card. You will find that many applications
(KDE-Address book, Apple Address book, MS Outlook, Evolution, etc.) can export
and import vCards.

This module offers only basic vcard features (folding, ...). Grouping, etc. is
not yet supported. For a complete description read the manualpages. Further
enhancements are always welcome.

This module has no other dependencies, it should work on every installation.

If you want to process several vCards (e.g. addressbooks) try the module
'Text::SimpleVaddrbook'.
